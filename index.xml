      <description>Objective The objective of this project is to analyze the early pandemic data of COVID-19 cases for five counties in the state of Florida using Microsoft Excel. The analysis will consist of the modeling of positive cases over a period (days) and the estimation of the growth rates for each county. Also, each county will be compared with one another to find similarities and/or differences. The exploration of possible causes of said comparisons will be highlighted in the analysis process as well.</description>
